## Special thanks to [@mobileposse](https://github.com/mobileposse), [John Lemp](https://github.com/duckworth), [Sean Broderick](https://github.com/hakutsuru), and [EPX Labs](https://github.com/epxlabs) for contributions to this effort.

Example of a useful serverless log analysis, reporting, and alerting pattern with the Serverless Framework on AWS. Leverages Kinesis and Elasticache (redis) services coupled with SES.
